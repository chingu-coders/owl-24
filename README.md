# Contribution Guide

For now, the only required thing you need to do when changing index.html, is changing this line:
<div>This is a stylesheet generator for styling your subreddit. To start, click the theme that you want. V0.XX</div>
Change the XXs to one tenth plus the current version number. For example:

<div>This is a stylesheet generator for styling your subreddit. To start, click the theme that you want. V0.05</div>
Turns into:
<div>This is a stylesheet generator for styling your subreddit. To start, click the theme that you want. V0.06</div>
